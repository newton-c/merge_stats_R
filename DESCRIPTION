Package: merge_stats
Type: Package
Title: Get feedback about the quality of your merges.
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Chris Newton
Maintainer: Chris Newton <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: This package builds of the `merge()` function from base
  R. It takes the same inputs with an additional input `show.stats`
  (default = `TRUE`). It returns a merged dataframe with an
  additional variable `merge` which that imitates the `_merge`
  variable from STATA. The variable is 1 for only the first dataframe
  merging, 2 for only the second dataframe merging, 3 if there's a
  perfect merge, and NA if there's an error. If `show.stats = TRUE`
  summaries of the merge are printed to screen.
